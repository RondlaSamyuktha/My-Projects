                 <p class="astyle1">Action movies are defined by their lead characters and villains. Usually, they're very clear-cut, with no grey area between right and wrong.
                 Action films and series usually thrust our heroes into challenges that typically include fighting, gun or swordplay, chase scenes, and extraordinary feats. The hero usually wins and the villain usually loses.

                <p class="astyle1">Thrillers are dramas that are full of physical conflict. They're not as concerned about the emotions of people in the story as they are about putting those characters in danger. They pack in unexpected twists and amp up tensions.
                 Most crime drama focuses on crime investigation and does not feature the courtroom.</p>
